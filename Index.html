                                 We are a company which claims to bring to market a new coffee which will revolutionize the coffee
                                 industry. The company was created as an inspiration of a couple who every morning took
                                 inspiration and started the day with a coffee that for the sake of truth did not taste the
                                 way they wanted. Hence the idea of trading coffee together with the coffee machine which
                                 is in this case is half of the taste in a cup coffee!
